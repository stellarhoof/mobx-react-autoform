# TODO

- Walk fields to validate on blur
- Expose method to get underlying dom node
- Ignore validation functions for hidden fields
- Support different layouts support? For checkbox or left labels
- Make the whole rules thing better so select component don't have to know about required
- Find a way to only forward layout props to a parent and the rest to a child
